## Background

Traditional tabular data processing technologies, such as distributed databases, data warehouses, 
and data lakes, have been continuously evolving and gradually maturing. In comparison, graph-based 
data processing technologies (graph databases, graph computing engines) provide new ideas and 
methods, but also face issues such as low ecological maturity and high barriers to product usage. 
With the rise of large language models (LLMs), how to effectively combine artificial intelligence 
technology with graph computing technology (Graph + AI) will be a very worthwhile direction to 
explore. On one hand, we can leverage cutting-edge technologies like LLMs and agents to 
lower the barriers to using graph computing products and enhance the user experience with graphs. 
On the other hand, graph computing technology can fully utilize the performance and 
interpretability advantages of graph data structures in relational analysis scenarios, assisting 
LLMs and intelligent agents in improving reasoning capabilities and generation quality.

## Introduction

Chat2Graph builds a multi-agent system (MAS) on top of a graph database to achieve intelligent 
capabilities in research and development, operations and maintenance, Q&A, generation, and more, 
helping users, developers, product managers, solution architects, operations engineers, and others 
to efficiently use graph databases, lower the barriers to using graphs, and accelerate content 
generation, implement dialogue with graphs. At the same time, leveraging the inherent advantages 
of graph data structures in relationship modeling, interpretability, etc., can enhance the key 
capabilities of intelligent agents such as reasoning, planning, memory, and tools, to achieve 
a deep integration of graph computing technology and artificial intelligence technology.

## Key Features

Chat2Graph currently provides basic capabilities of intelligent agent systems, but there are 
still many features that need to be improved together with the community.

## Quick Start

### Preparation

Prepare the required versions of Python and NodeJS.

* Install Python: [Python == 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads) recommended.
* Install NodeJS: [NodeJS >= v20](https://nodejs.org/en/download) recommended.

You can also use tools like [conda][conda] to install the python environment.

### Build & Start

Build Chat2Graph as follows.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TuGraph-family/chat2graph.git
cd chat2graph
./bin/build.sh
```

Then configure environment variables (e.g., LLM parameters) based on 
[.env.template](.env.template), startup Chat2Graph.

```bash
cp .env.template .env && vim .env
./bin/start.sh
```

When you see the following log:

```text

 * Serving Flask app 'bootstrap'
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.

```

You can access Chat2Graph in the browser at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/):

## Register Graph Database

After registering the graph database to Chat2Graph in "Backend Manager", you can experience the complete ability 
of "chat to graph".
![](doc/img/gdb-mng.png)

The currently supported graph databases are:

* Neo4j

```bash
docker pull neo4j:latest
docker run -d -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 --name neo4j-server --env NEO4J_AUTH=none neo4j:latest
```

* TuGraph

```bash
docker pull tugraph/tugraph-runtime-centos7:4.5.1
docker run -d -p 7070:7070 -p 7687:7687 -p 9090:9090 --name tugraph-server \
  tugraph/tugraph-runtime-centos7:latest lgraph_server -d run --enable_plugin true
```

### Use SDK

The SDK of Chat2Graph provides a very clear and concise API, allowing you to easily build access 
to your intelligent system.

You can quickly converse with the built-in Chat2Graph in the following ways.

```python
SystemEnv.LLM_NAME="gpt-4o-mini"
SystemEnv.LLM_ENDPOINT="https://api.openai.com/v1"
SystemEnv.LLM_APIKEY="<YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY>"

mas = AgenticService.load()
question = TextMessage(payload = "What is TuGraph ?")
answer = mas.execute(question).get_payload()
```

At the same time, the SDK also provides asynchronous dialogue capabilities.

```python
job = mas.session().submit(question)
answer = job.wait().get_payload()
```

Of course, customizing your own intelligent agent is also allowed.

```python
mas = AgenticService("Chat2Graph")
mas.expert(name="Graph Modeling Expert").workflow(
        (analysis_operator, concept_modeling_operator)
    ).build()
```

To facilitate the rapid configuration of agents, you can describe the details of the agent 
using a YAML file and load it directly.

```python
mas = AgenticService.load("app/core/sdk/chat2graph.yml")
```
