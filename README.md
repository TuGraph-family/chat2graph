## Contributing

Chat2Graph currently only provides basic agent system capabilities. We look forward to your participation in co-building graph native agentic system.

This is our technical roadmap:

- Reasoning && Planning
  - [x] One-Active-Many-Passive hybrid multi-agent architecture.
  - [x] Dual-LLM reasoning machine combining fast & slow thinking.
  - [x] Chain of agents (CoA) oriented task decomposition and graph planner.
  - [ ] Workflow auto-generation.
  - [ ] Action recommendation in operator.
  - [ ] Structured agent role management.
  - [ ] Agent task compiler.
- Memory && Knowledge
  - [x] Hierarchical memory system.
  - [x] Vector and graph knowledge base.
  - [ ] Knowledge refinement mechanism.
  - [ ] Environment management.
- Tool && System
  - [x] Toolkit knowledge graph.
  - [ ] Toolkit graph optimizer.
  - [ ] Rich toolkit/MCP integration.
  - [ ] Unified resource manager.
  - [ ] Tracing and control capabilities.
  - [ ] Benchmark.
- Product && Ecosystem
  - [x] Concise intelligent agent SDK.
  - [x] Web Service and interaction.
  - [x] One-click configuration of agents.
  - [ ] Multimodal capabilities.
  - [ ] Production enhancement.
  - [ ] Integration with open-source ecosystems.
